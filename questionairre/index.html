            CONFUSING?</h1>
        <p class="answer">My previous experience with coding was core 1 interaction. I enjoyed using javascript 
            to built more interactive experiences on my website. Javascript was also the most confusing. Creating 
            a consistent layout was difficult for me. (aligning items, sizing images/divs/iframes) I had a really 
            hard time getting any semi-complex functions working without the help of chat gpt
