        <h1>1. DESCRIBE YOUR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WITH CODING. WHAT CLASSES HAVE YOU ALREADY TAKEN WHERE YOU 
            WERE EXPOSED TO HTML/CSS/JS? WHAT PARTS OF THE CLASS RESONATED WITH YOU? WHAT PARTS WERE MOST 
            CONFUSING?</h1>
            <p class="answer">My previous experience with coding was core 1 interaction. I enjoyed using javascript 
            to built more interactive experiences on my website. Javascript was also the most confusing. Creating 
            a consistent layout was difficult for me. (aligning items, sizing images/divs/iframes) I had a really 
            hard time getting any semi-complex functions working without the help of chat gpt
            </p>
        <h1>2. HOW EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING CODE ARE YOU? ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT LEARNING CODE? IF SO, WHY? WHAT CAN I DO 
            IN THIS CLASS TO HELP REDUCE THIS ANXIETY?
        </h1>
        <p class="answer">I  probably would not be taking this class if I didn’t have to but I am looking forward to 
            the things I will learn.
        </p>
        <h1>3. HOW DO YOU IMAGINE CODING FITTING IN WITH THE REST OF YOUR DESIGN CURRICULUM AND CAREER AFTER COLLEGE?
        </h1>

            and knowledge are valuable regardless.

        </h1>

        <p class="answer">Using the Analogy of a home - <br>
            HTML is the framing of the house, creating walls, floors, rooms, etc.<br>
