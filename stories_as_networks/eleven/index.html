      With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter. In the first, an army marches
      \ into battle over a desolate mountain pass. The bleak and somber aspect of the rocky landscape 
      made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value, and so they won the battle easily. 
      In the second, the same army passes through a palace where a banquet is in progress. The splendor 
      of the feast remained a memory throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed. 

With proper veneration I listened to these old tales, although perhaps with less admiration for them in 
themselves than for the fact that they had been thought out by one of my own blood, and that a man of a 
distant empire had given them back to me, in the last stage of a desperate adventure, on a Western island. 
I remember the final words, repeated at the end of each version like a secret command: "Thus the heroes fought,
 with tranquil heart and bloody sword. They were resigned to killing and to dying."
