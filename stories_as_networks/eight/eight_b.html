            "Those of the blood of Ts'ui Pen," I replied, "still curse the memory of that monk. Such a publication was madness. The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory rough drafts. I examined it once upon a time: the hero dies in the third chapter, while in the fourth he is alive. As for that other enterprise of Ts'ui Pen ... his Labyrinth..."

            "Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall, laquered writing cabinet. 
            
            "An ivory labyrinth?" I exclaimed. "A tiny labyrinth indeed...!"

                We sat down, I upon a large, low divan, he with his back to the window and to a large circular clock. I calculated that my pursuer, Richard Madden, could not arrive in less than an hour. My irrevocable decision could wait. 

"A strange destiny," said Stephen Albert, "that of Ts'ui Pen - Governor of his native province, learned in astronomy, in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the canonical books, a chess player, a famous poet and a calligrapher. Yet he abandoned all to make a book and a labyrinth. He gave up all the pleasures of oppression, justice, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut himself up in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen years. At his death, his heirs found only a mess of manuscripts. The family, as you doubtless know, wished to consign them to the fire, but the executor of the estate - a Taoist or a Buddhist monk - insisted on their publication."

        <p>The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the house,
            we went into a library filled with books from both East and West. I recognized
             some large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia 
             which was edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty. They had never
              been printed. A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix. I remember
               also a rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many centuries, of that
                blue color which our potters copied from the Persians...

           Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I have said,
            remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard.
             There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor. Later, 
             he told me he had been a missionary in Tientsin before he "had aspired to become
             \ a Sinologist."
