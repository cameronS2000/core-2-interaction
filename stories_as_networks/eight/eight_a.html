        <p>Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the hunted. 
            For an undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world,
             an abstract spectator. The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the
              decline of the evening, stirred within me. Going down the gently sloping
               road I could not feel fatigue. The evening was at once intimate and infinite. 
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="page" id="page_two">
       <p> The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight.
         A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the 
         breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance. 

        I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of 
        other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, streams, 
        or the West wind. 
        
        Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could 
        see an avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion.
         Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: 
         the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had accepted
          it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there was a bell, 
          a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The stuttering 
          sparks of the music kept on. 
          </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="page" id="page_three">
        <p>
            But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a
             lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put 
             out by the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored 
             like the moon. A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me. 

            </br>He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language. 

            </br>"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. No doubt you want to see the garden?" 

            </br>Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback. 

            </br>"The garden?" 

            </br>"The garden of forking paths." 

            </br>Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: 

            </br>"The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen." 

            </br>"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."

        </p>
