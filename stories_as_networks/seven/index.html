         A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow. 
         One of them asked me: "Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?"
         Without waiting for my answer, another said: "The house is a good distance
          away but you won't get lost if you take the road to the left and 
          bear to the left at every crossroad." I threw them a coin (my last), went 
          down some stone steps and started along a deserted road. At a slight 
          incline, the road ran downhill. It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the
           branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky 
           as if to keep me company. 

         For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have divined my desperate
         intent. At once I realized that this would be impossible. The advice about turning 
         always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for finding the central 
         courtyard of certain labyrinths. I know something about labyrinths. Not for nothing
         am I the greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen. He was Governor of Yunnan and gave up temporal 
         power to write a novel with more characters than there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and 
         to create a maze in which all men would lose themselves. He spent thirteen years on these 
         oddly assorted tasks before he was assassinated by a stranger. His novel had no sense to 
          it and nobody ever found his labyrinth. 

Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite, made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdoms ... I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars.
