<div class="body">... and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in German. It was that of Captain Richard <span class=madden>madden</span>. 
    <span class=madden>madden</span>, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have seemed 
    so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that Runeberg had been arrested or murdered. 1 Before the sun set on this same 
    day, I ran the same risk. <span class=madden>madden</span> was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be implacable. An Irishman in the service 
    of England, a man suspected of equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and seize upon this 
    extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two agents of Imperial Germany? 

    I went up to my bedroom. Absurd though the gesture was, I closed and locked the door. I threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited
     on my back. The never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky. It seemed incredible that 
     this day, a day without warnings or omens, might be that of my implacable death. In despite of my dead father, in despite of having 
     been a child in one of the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was I to die now?
