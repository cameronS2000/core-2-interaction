            In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name of the one
             person capable of passing on the information. He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half
              an hour away by train. 

            I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky plan to an
             end. It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was terrible. I did not
              do it for Germany - no! Such a barbarous country is of no importance to me, particularly since 
              it had degraded me by making me become a spy. Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest 
              man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but 
              during that time, he was Goethe.
