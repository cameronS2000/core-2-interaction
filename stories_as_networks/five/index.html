            <p class="title">I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering at me.
                 Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself - made me empty out my pockets. I 
                 found just what I knew I was going to find. The American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin,
                  the key ring with the useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a letter which 
                  I decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two single shillings and 
                  some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a revolver with a single bullet. Absurdly I held 
                  it and weighed it in my hand, to give myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for 
                  a great distance.
