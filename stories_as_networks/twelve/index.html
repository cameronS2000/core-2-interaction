      At that moment I felt within me and around me something invisible and intangible pullulating. It was not the pullulation of two divergent,
       parallel, and finally converging armies, but an agitation more inaccessible, more intimate, prefigured by them in some way. Stephen Albert 
       continued: </br>

      "I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations. I do not find it believable that he would waste thirteen years laboring 
      over a never ending experiment in rhetoric. In your country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's period, it was a despised one. Ts'ui 
      Pen was a fine novelist but he was also a man of letters who, doubtless, considered himself more than a mere novelist. The testimony of his 
      \contemporaries attests to this, and certainly the known facts of his life confirm his leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical. Philosophical 
      conjectures take up the greater part of his novel. I know that of all problems, none disquieted him more, and none concerned him more than the profound 
      one of time. Now then, this is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden. He does not even use the word which means time. How can 
      these voluntary omissions be explained?" </br>
      
      I proposed various solutions, all of them inadequate. We discussed them. Finally Stephen Albert said: "In a guessing game to which the answer is chess,
       which word is the only one prohibited?" I thought for a moment and then replied: 
      
      "The word is chess." 
      
      "Precisely," said Albert. "The Garden of Forking Paths is an enormous guessing game, or parable, in which the subject is time. The rules of the game forbid
       the use of the word itself. To eliminate a word completely, to refer to it by means of inept phrases and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best way of 
       drawing attention to it. This, then, is the tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique Ts'ui Pen in every meandering of his interminable novel. 
       I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, I have worked out the plan from this chaos, I have 
       restored, or believe I have restored, the original. I have translated the whole work. I can state categorically that not once has the word time been used 
       in the whole book.
