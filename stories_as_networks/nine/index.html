    <p class="body">"A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me. "An invisible labyrinth of time. 
      I, a barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery. After 
      more than a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all recall,
       but it isn't hard to image what must have happened. At one time, Ts'ui Pen must have 
       said; 'I am going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, 'I am retiring to construct 
       a maze.' Everyone assumed these were separate activities. No one realized that the book 
       and the labyrinth were one and the same. The Pavilion of the Limpid Sun was set in the
        middle of an intricate garden. This may have suggested the idea of a physical maze.

    <p class="body_right">"Ts'ui Pen died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to your family, no 
      one could find the labyrinth. The novel's confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth. 

      Two circumstances showed me the direct solution to the problem. First, the curious legend that 
      Ts'ui Pen had proposed to create an infinite maze, second, a fragment of a letter which I discovered." 
      
      Albert rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me. He opened the top drawer in the high black 
      and gilded writing cabinet. He returned holding in his hand a piece of paper which had once been 
      crimson but which had faded with the passage of time: it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular.
       Ts'ui Pen's calligraphy was justly famous. Eagerly, but without understanding, I read the words 
       which a man of my own blood had written with a small brush: "I leave to various future times, but 
       not to all, my garden of forking paths."
