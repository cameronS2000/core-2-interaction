    <div class="left">"The explanation is obvious. The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, 
        incomplete yet not false, of the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be. Differing
         from Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and uniform. 
         He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network 
         of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time - the strands of which approach 
         one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries - embraces every
         possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some you exist and not I, while in others I
          do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us exist. In this one, in which chance has favored
           me, you have come to my gate. In another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. In
            yet another, I say these very same words, but am an error, a phantom."

    <div class="right">
        "In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my voice. "I deeply appreciate and am grateful to you for the restoration of Ts'ui Pen's garden."
    </div>
    
    <div class="left2">
        "Not in all," he murmured with a smile. "Time is forever dividing itself toward innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy."
    </div>
    <div class="left3">
        Once again I sensed the pullulation of which I have already spoken. It seemed to me that the dew-damp
         garden surrounding the house was infinitely saturated with invisible people. All were Albert and myself,
          secretive, busy and multiform in other dimensions of time. I lifted my eyes and the short nightmare 
          disappeared. In the black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a 
          statue and this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.

    <div class="right2">
        "The future exists now," I replied. "But I am your friend. Can I take another look at the letter?"

Albert rose from his seat. He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high writing cabinet. For a 
moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver ready. I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell 
without a murmur, at once. I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning.
