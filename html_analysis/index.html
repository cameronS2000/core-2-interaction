          <p>one thing I noticed about most websites before I chose this one to analyze is that there are body attributes. This isn't something that I have had to do within my websites yet.</p>
          <p>I didn't know the form tag. After some research I found that it's for data input by the user.</p>
          <p>The header is more straight forward. It contains two divs separating the site navigation from the more personalized user buttons.</p>
          <p>The main-wrap div contains what would probably be considered the main content of the website. These div classes didn't seem to affect the page when deleted so I am assuming they are mainly used for ease of editting.</p>
          <p> things started to fall apart when I began removing the attributes of divs inside of the sub-lobby-divs. Most issues were related to text formatting and colors of containers and buttons.</p>

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The homescreen has live updating chess games in containers. What tags/containers are used to fetch live updates?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>what do all the body attributes mean? Why might a website need them and at what point will I begin using them?</p>
